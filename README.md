# gnome-caps-apps-toggle
Gnome extension that makes Caps Lock key open application grid and adds a button to the top bar that also opens the application grid.

The extension removes all existing Caps Lock XKB options and sets `caps:hyper` which remaps Caps Lock to Hyper.
If you already use Hyper for shortcuts, then this extension will break those.
